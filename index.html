      <h3>Sensoji Temple</h3>
      <p> The Sensoji Temple in Tokyo Asakusa district is one of the most colorful
        and most popular temple in japan. It is also Tokyo's oldest temple. The legend
        goes that in 628, two brothers found a statue of Kannon, the godddess of
        mercy, in the Sumida River. When the brothers tried to return the statue
        it always found its way back to them. Thus, the temple was built in her
        honor. This temple really shows the rich culture that tokyo has to offer.</p>
